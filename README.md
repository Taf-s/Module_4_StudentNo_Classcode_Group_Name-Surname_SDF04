# SDF04 Project

This is the readme file for the CSS button styling project 

## Description

The purpose of the project was to style three buttons usin CSS. Applying different types of styling to each button. In order to do so I had to first clone the repository onto my local machine, style it in my code editor, commit the changes and push it back to my GitHub repository. 

## Design Choices 

For the project I chose to style my buttons using different colour paletes for each one. 

For the first button, i went for a much more simpler design, using the hsl properties that highlghted a mostly red colour to the button, futher more, i then added some box shadows and a slight animation so that the button hovers on click. 

For the second button i opted for a much more sytlised approach. The initial colour palete of the button on view is a salmon colour palete, but then when you hover over it, it changes to blue colour palate. 

For the third button i went with a lime green colour palete. I changed the text inside the box to white so that its easier to read. The i applied some animation to make the border radius change from a box to rounded corners. 

## Features 

Overall i was quite pleased with the styling i chose for all the buttons, but the features i am particullarly proud of are: 

* the hover effect with the box shadow on button 1 
* the colour change animation on button 2 
* the animation on the border radius on button 3
